DeathCounter v0.2.0 - Count and rank your player and monster kills in Minecraft
by krinsdeath

Version 0.2.0:
    - Finished SQLite support!
    - Added permissions support (optional) - the flag is "deathcounter.admin" and gives access to the /deathcount reset command
    - Reorganized the entire project. The source is very tidy now, and much more module-like. It should allow me to make new features very easily.

Version 0.1.3:
    - Hardcoded limit on number of loops displayed when typing /deathcount leaders [num]
    - minor code cleanup
    - Added configurable location for users.yml; should allow for symlinking to a shared memory location for more stability on large servers
Version 0.1.2:
    - Added /deathcount reset for admins.
    - Added quiet_plugin field in config.yml - setting this to true will disable "You killed a [target]!" messages.
    - Cleaned up code.
    - More localization flags
Version 0.1.1:
    - Fixed a few bugs
    - Added support for EntityDamageByProjectileEvent
    - Players should now be tracked properly
    - Added quiet_save field in config.yml - setting this to true will disable log messages stating that the users.yml has been updated.
Version 0.1.0:
    - Initial release
